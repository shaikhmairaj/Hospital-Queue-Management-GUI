# Hospital-Queue-Management-GUI
This project is a part of my (DSA) course at university.A Java Swing-based desktop application for efficiently managing hospital patient queues. The system allows hospital staff to add patients with severity levels, call the next patient in line, search for patients, and display both the current queue and discharged patients.
